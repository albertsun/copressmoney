copressmoney - basic spreadsheet app, originally developed for CoPress (a small web host company) to keep track of accounts 

We used Google Docs to keep track of accounts, but this streamlines the entry process for sales, and let us better manage accounts receivable, and credit unearned revenue from sales to future months

To set up, just run:
./manage.py syncdb
